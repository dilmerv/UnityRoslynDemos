# Unity Roslyn Demos

Unity demos with [Roslyn C# compiler](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) tools which allow you to compile and inspect C# code at runtime.

I've created couple of Unity scenes which demonstrate how to use the RoslynCodeRunner.cs which currently provides you with the following options shown on the inspector image below:

### Requirements
Unity 2021.3.8f1 or greater (This could work with earlier version but not tested yet)

### Future improvements
1. Documenting how to get Roslyn C# DLLs compiled with .NET Standard
